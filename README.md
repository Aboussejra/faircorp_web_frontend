# README
You may look at the deployed website directly here : https://faircorp-web-app.onrender.com/
Yet, there may be a problem of the data displaying. That is because you need your browser to accept a certificate from the backend. To do so you may go once there :

https://boussejra.amir.faircorp.cleverapps.io/swagger-ui/index.html
(which is the base API for the Backend, and accept the certificate).
Then all should work, it has been tested on a linux and windows computer. As well as the install and the build.

Feel free to send me an email at amir at boussejra dot come if a problem happen visiting the website or building.
